John Lewis
==========
iOS Developer Technical Test â€“ Dishwasher App
=============================================

Instructions
-------

Clone the project into your mac. The repo include the Pods/ directory, so you don't need to run 'pod install'.
Open JLDishwashers.xcworkspace to run the app on the simulator (or on a physical device)

Notes
-----
- John Lewis font wasn't in the instructions directory, so I used the system one.
- I used the following 3rd part library:
  - Alamofire
  - AlamofireImage
  - SwiftyJSON
- I used Alamofire and AlamofireImage because with just one line of code I can use a REST API to GET the resources I need. They're also been tested a lot by all the developers who are using them, so they are very reliable.
- I used SwiftyJSON because it transform a simple String into an object that I can use as a NSDictionary or NSArray (it extends CollectionType and SequenceType)
- The app is not 'pixel perfect' and the UX can be improved
